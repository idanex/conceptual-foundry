## What is this place?

This repository is not a collection of open-source tools. It is a **foundry for paradigm-shifting ideas**. Each project within is an artifact of research, a conceptual system formalized into code to challenge the limits of computation and design.

The works presented here are offered to the community for study, inspiration, and contemplation.
